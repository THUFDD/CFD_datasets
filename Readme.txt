The experimental data is collected from a realistic large-scale rotating machinery fault diagnosis experimental platform. The test rig is utilized in Guangdong Province Key Laboratory for petrochemical equipment fault diagnosis. Initial vibration signals are obtained by sensors installed on the gearbox with a US CTC accelerometer mounted vertically on the gearbox. In detail, it is a centrifugal multi-stage impeller blower with crucial components such as a three-phase induction motor, gearbox, bearing, load, and shaft. In addition, gear wheels and pinions are engaged and abrade mutually inside the gearbox.

The descriptions of data folds are summarized as follows.

F0: Normal bearing; Normal gearwheel
F1: Normal bearing; Defective gearwheel 
F2: Defective inner-ring of bearing; Normal gearwheel
F3: Defective inner-ring of bearing; Defective gearwheel 
F4: Defective outer-ring of bearing; Normal gearwheel
F5: Defective outer-ring of bearing; Defective gearwheel 
F6: Bearing with the absence of balls; Normal gearwheel
F7: Bearing with the absence of balls; Defective gearwheel
